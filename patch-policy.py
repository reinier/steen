"""Add a sigstoreSigned trust entry for the ghcr.io/reinier namespace.

Steen is what this machine boots, so it must verify its own update stream rather
than inherit that trust from the base. The fedora-ostree-desktops base ships only
Fedora's default container policy, so establish the ghcr.io/reinier chain from
scratch. The base manages its container policy via the bootc factory template
(/usr/share/factory/etc/containers/policy.json), which populates /etc at boot;
some builds also materialize /etc directly. Patch every policy.json that exists so
the entry is present whichever file the system ends up reading.
